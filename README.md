# CWE-184
 Demonstration of CWE-184: Incomplete List of Disallowed Inputs made for an Information Security class.

# Usage
1. Run files on a local Apache server (for the purposes of this, I used XAMPP).
2. The webpage accepts any txt file and prints its contents.
3. 2 Test files are provided: 1 safe .txt file and 1 malicious .php file that shuts down the server.
4. If running evilfile.php does not shutdown the local server, navigate the exact server exe file being run in Control Panel. Alternatively, try refreshing the webpage which should result in server shutdown.

Feel free to download for personal use and tinker with the variables!
